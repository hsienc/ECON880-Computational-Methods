I work on this pset1 on my own. The folder contains necessary materials:

1. `parallel_stochastic_growth_functions.jl`: a modified version from parallel_functions.jl on Dean's website. Add technology shocks into loops.

2. `parallel_stochastic_growth_script.jl`: this runs the above .jl and generates 3 png files

3. `Main.pdf`: write-up
